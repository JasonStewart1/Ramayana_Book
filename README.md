Ramayana Book
=============

**Introduction:**


Book about Ramayana ( One of the two great epics of Hinduism ) ascribed by Valmiki

The Ramayana consists of 24,000 verses in seven books (kāṇḍas) and 500 cantos (sargas)

Ramayana tells the story of Rama (an avatar of the Hindu supreme-god Vishnu), whose wife Sita is abducted by Ravana, the king of Lanka (current day Sri Lanka). Thematically, the Ramayana explores human values and the concept of dharma.

The seven kandas (books) of Ramayana are as follows:

  - Sundara Kāṇḍa (Book of beauty)
  - Yuddha Kāṇḍa (Book of war, also known as Lanka Kanda)
  - Uttara Kāṇḍa (Last book)
