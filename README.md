Ramayana_Book
=============

**Introduction:**


Book about Ramayana ( One of the two great epics of Hinduism ) ascribed by Valmiki

The Ramayana consists of 24,000 verses in seven books (kāṇḍas) and 500 cantos (sargas)

Ramayana tells the story of Rama (an avatar of the Hindu supreme-god Vishnu), whose wife Sita is abducted by Ravana, the king of Lanka (current day Sri Lanka). Thematically, the Ramayana explores human values and the concept of dharma.

The seven kandas (books or maybe chapters or phases) of Ramayana are as follows:

  - Bāla Kāṇḍa (Book of childhood)
  - Ayodhya Kāṇḍa (Book of ayodhya)3
  - Araṇya Kāṇḍa (Book of the forest)
  - Kishkindha Kāṇḍa (Book of the monkey kingdom)
  - Sundara Kāṇḍa (Book of beauty)
  - Yuddha Kāṇḍa (Book of war, also known as Lanka Kanda)
  - Uttara Kāṇḍa (Last book)

**Development**

I/we would like to create a portable version of epic Ramayana in any format (html,pdf,word etc) to preserve one of the best books ever written in hindu mythology.

We would appreciate if anyone could provide good resources to start.

### Presently working on ###

  -  Instead of writing .md files for all the slokas, we would prefer to put in .json file and node script to convert to .md ( This way we can even be sure that we could able to create an API for Ramayana so that anyone can use in their application )
  -  (sanskrit version) developing / writing balakanda chapter1.json and node script to convert to md

### Final goals ###

  -  Release pdf,html version of Ramayana in sanskrit,english and telugu ( Will add more languages as we could more people contibuting )
  -  Develop API so anyone can use Ramayana in their own application
  -  Website showcasing the html version of the book
